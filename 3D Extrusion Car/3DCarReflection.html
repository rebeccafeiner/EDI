<h1>3D Car Reflection</h1>

<p>In this 3D Extrusion Car project, we created a 3D model and a 3D printed toy car to scale, attempting to create the most accurate representation of the toy car we modeled our print after as possible. The concepts of the X, Y, and Z planes were used when we were 3D modeling and we learned how our car shape was defined on the different planes. After creating the drawing of our model and using CAD to define our shapes in 2D then extrude that shape to make it a 3D form, we printed these 3D forms on the 3D printer. </p>

<h3>Guidelines</h3>
<p>The guidelines for this project were:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Car designed as an intersection of three forms</li>
<li>3D car is designed in a 1:1 ratio to its model</li>
<li>Size accuracy ±1%</li>
<li>The design is exported as an stl</li>
<li>Model is oriented in Cura for 3D printing to minimize support material</li>
<li>The file is exported as a gcode</li>
<li>The final design is shared as an embedded STL on an HTML webpage
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Steps</h3>
<p>The steps for this project were:</p>

<ul>
<p>1. Drawing</p>
<p>2. 3D Modeling</p>
<p>3. Slicing and printing</p>
<p>4. Documentation</p>
</ul>


<h3>Process</h3>

<p>Before the process started, we each created an OnShape account, installed Cura, and chose a toy car. Then, to start the process, the first step was the drawing. We measured our chosen cars then drew the car to scale on a piece of graph paper as an Engineering Drawing. Then it was scanned or photographed, and we captured screenshots of each plane side, then uploaded the entire Engineering Drawing to GitHub.</p>

<p>The next part of the process was the 3D Modeling. In OnShape, we drew each profile from the Engineering Drawing onto each plane side. Then, the extrusion tool was used to remove the negative spaces from the 3D form. Then the extrusion and fillet tools were used to add details and smooth and finalize the car. The STL file was then exported.</p>

<p>Next up in our process was the slicing and printing. The design was imported into Cura, where any final scaling changes were made, the 3D model was positioned onto a build plate to minimize the amount of support material, and the setting was set to a 0.6mm nozzle for the 3D printer. This was then exported as a GCODE file, and the model was printed.</p>

<p>In the final part of the process, documentation, we created a CAD drawing and calculated the margin of error. Last, we imported the design into Modelo to make a 3D model by embedding our STL file, and added a photo of the car next to its model into the Slide Deck.</p>

<h3>Setbacks and Solutions</h3>


<p>One setback I had was that when I was attempting to measure the height of my car in my CAD Drawing using the dimensions tool, it didn’t allow me to measure from the top of the car to the bottom of the wheel, so I could not measure the full height. In order to solve this, I created a line with the Line Tool tangent to the bottom edge of my wheels, then measured the distance between that line and the top of my car to get the height of the car using the dimensions tool. Another setback that I encountered was when I was creating my CAD Drawing, the isometric view of the car faced backwards. In order to solve this problem, I needed to alter the position of the car to make the car face frontwards, so I used the Projected View tool on my OnShape document to play around with the perspective of my car and eventually found a good view.</p>
